As far as I know, there is no existing method using weakest precondition.\\n\\n### Weakness\\n- Though the number and quality of baselines looks sufficient to me, benchmark problem is very easy. I think the authors should have tested their method in MuJoCo or SafetyGym benchmarks. The proposed method depends on environment approximation; hence, it is particularly important to know whether it is applicable to non-linear complicated system (I think even negative results are ok, and it is significant to know the limitations).\\n- Low applicability to real problems. As the authors discuss the experimental results in the first paragraph on page 8, the proposed method works better than baselines when the environment can be approximated with linear equations. I think this is a huge limitation of the proposed method. I personally recommend the authors to connect this work with Linear MDP (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05388.pdf), which would provide much richer theoretical results and good empirical results under the assumption of feature mapping functions.\\n\\n### Questions\\n- How did the author choose weakest preconditions for each experiments? Is it possible to decrease the constraints violation while tuning the parameter of the weakest preconditions?\\n\\n### Other comments\\n- The equation in Section 2 should be rewritten\\n    - (Section 2) $\\\\text{Safe}(\\\\pi)$ is not defined.\\n    - Is $P_{xâˆ¼S{_{\\\\pi_i}}}(x \\\\in S_U ) < \\\\delta$ really what the authors want to represent?
